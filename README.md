# E-Commerce-Dashboard

**About the project:**

In the rapidly evolving world of e-commerce, businesses must leverage clear, data-driven insights to ensure their success. To meet this need, I developed a comprehensive Power BI report using the FP20 Challenge dataset (https://fp20analytics.com/datasets/).

This report carefully examines sales volumes and profitability across various product categories and global markets. It places a strong emphasis on key performance indicators (KPIs), which are essential for understanding business performance and informing strategic decision-making. Overall, it serves as a valuable tool for effectively navigating the complexities of the industry.

**Objective:**

The objective was to achieve an average annual profit margin of 20%, attain 20% overall annual sales growth, and secure at least $400,000 in annual sales for each market. The dashboard visualizes these key performance indicators (KPIs) and offers actionable insights to support strategic decision-making and foster business growth.

**About The Dashboard:**

The dashboard has been thoughtfully organized into three distinct sections, each catering to the specific needs of different user groups within the company:

  ◆ **Executives:** The Commerce Overview section presents a concise yet comprehensive snapshot of the company’s overall performance. It provides key metrics such as total sales, profit 
                     margins, and progress toward essential targets. This high-level view enables executives to quickly evaluate the business's trajectory, allowing them to make informed decisions without wading through intricate details.

  ◆ **Regional Managers:** The Market Insights section is specifically designed for regional managers, enabling them to closely monitor the performance of various markets. This section   
                        highlights top-selling products and sales volume by region, making it easy to identify which areas are most profitable. By analyzing this data, regional managers can 
                        adapt their strategies to capitalize on local market trends, ensuring a more targeted approach to sales and marketing.

  ◆ **Product Managers:** The Customer & Product section provides an in-depth analysis of customer behavior, product profitability, and the effects of discount strategies on profit margins. This granular level of detail is vital for product managers, as it helps them identify which customer segments and products are most successful. Additionally, understanding how discounting impacts profitability allows them to refine pricing strategies and optimize product offerings for maximum financial performance.

**Key Insights:**

Based on the data, the dashboard revealed the following insights:

◆ **Sales Performance:** For the year 2023, overall sales grew by 24%. However, this growth fell short of the 20% target, reaching only $2.19 million compared to a goal of $2.63 million. This shortfall indicates that strategic adjustments are necessary to enhance performance in underperforming regions.

◆ **Profit Margin:** The company did not meet its profit margin goal, achieving only 16% against a target of 20%. This suggests that both pricing strategies and cost management require strategic attention.

◆ **Corporate Sales:** The corporate segment experienced growth but remained slightly below its 30% target, with a $60,000 gap to close to meet this goal.

◆ **Market Leader:** The Asia Pacific region stands out as a leader in sales, surpassing the $400,000 sales goal. In contrast, other regions like LATAM and Africa are lagging, highlighting potential growth opportunities.

◆ **Trending Products:** Body care products continue to be the top-selling category; however, they are experiencing shrinking profit margins due to aggressive discounting.

◆ **Discount Impact:** Discounts exceeding 20% significantly diminish profit margins, particularly for Body Care and Makeup products, which often see profits dip into negative territory when discounts are too steep.
